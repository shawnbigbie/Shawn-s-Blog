          <h2 class="section-heading">What have you done this week?</h2>

          <p>
            During this week (Dec 7thth - Dec 11th) I finished the Project the best that I could and for what I was able to do and provide time wise.
          </p>

          <p>
            Below are the things I doubled checked and made sure worked as needed in order to finish up the project.
          </p>

            <li>User was able to change a rating of a recipe</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What was I not able to add or Finish with the project?</h2>

          <p>
            Things that I diden't add or now how to fix.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Bug for Setup Heroku</li>
            <li>Setup Cross Items off of a shopping list</li>
            <li>Being able to add ingredients to a list while looking at a recipe</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Why where you not able to add or fix these problems.</h2>
          <br>

          <h4>Setuping Heroku up</h4>

          <p>
            Bug for Setup Heroku was a huge problem as shouldn't have been, last week and this week I kept on looking into this and tried to understand why this is happening even tried recodeing most of the setup of the project and renaming files to see where the link was connected. Even looked at resources like this one <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39015893/heroku-deploy-error-cannot-find-module-app-index-js" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="./img/bug.PNG">

          <p>
            Over all kept on geting frustrated and dident want to spend anymore time on solveing this project since I have had it work in the past and had experiance with other project that work with heroku. Also since I saw it was only 10 points on the final for not haveing it served live and could miss some points.
          </p>

          <h4>Being able to add ingredients to a list while looking at a recipe</h4>

          <p>
            Then there was the design with my project not that the design is bad, just not the best foundation and structure since we where not able to think about design and plan it out that much with the time we had. Since I started with this list type of design which is great for the user flow and accessibility, it made it hard to have the two lists next to each other for adding ingredients to a list while looking at a recipe.
          </p>

          <h4>Setup Cross Items off of a shopping list</h4>

          <p>
            With this problem I would have been able to do easily and create a more user friendly UI if I knew more about how to use diffrent HTML form elements with Node and Databases. This is also a topic that I looked into trying to use Textareas and not input fields, and useing type="checkbox" for crossing items off.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another reason why this was hard to impment even when I did fine some infomation was beacuse I was working with strings and not arrays. Looking back now and if I had the time I would have made most of the data storded in arrays since its more easier to work with them on the frount end and displaying the data.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">What did you learn from this project and this course?</h2>

          <p>
            Most of the infomation I have learned this course have been from watching Youtube tutorials that have teached me everything that the course has wanted us to learn (Node.js, Express, Template Engines, Advance JS, and diffrent types of Databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Firebase). I also watched all of the class recording for extra help and to make sure im not missing something impotant.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't think that I can say that am confident and know everything about these topics and definitely need to pratice more with each of these topics that I have learned. However for the most part I have learned and understood a lot from this course and by watching tutorials on how to apply the basics and learning how to implment others techniques to fit and be turned into something else that can work for my projects.
